# noirdoc

**German-first PII redaction and pseudonymization for documents. Local by default. Reversible when you need it.**

Noirdoc redacts names, addresses, phone numbers, IBANs, Steuer-IDs, SVNRs, and the rest — from PDFs, DOCX, XLSX, and plain text — without sending anything to a third party. Under the hood it's a rules-based Presidio pipeline by default, and an ensemble (Presidio + GLiNER + Flair) when the `[full]` extra is installed. It's built for real-world German documents and mixed DE/EN text — the kind of stuff Mittelstand actually runs through an LLM.

> **Status:** alpha (`0.2.x`). API will change before `1.0`. Pin the minor version.

## Prerequisites

- Python **3.12** or **3.13**
- ~1 GB free disk if you install the `[full]` extra (spaCy + Flair + GLiNER weights)
- Optional: a Redis instance if you want shared mapping storage across workers (`[redis]` extra)

## Install

```bash
# Baseline — Presidio + all file extractors + reversible mapper.
pip install noirdoc

# Full ensemble (adds GLiNER + Flair, large ML weights). Recommended for real work.
pip install noirdoc[full]
noirdoc models pull

# Optional distributed mapper backend.
pip install noirdoc[redis]
```

For anything beyond toy examples, use `noirdoc[full]` — the ensemble catches what the baseline misses, especially on German lowercase text.

## Quickstart

```bash
# One-shot redact (ephemeral mapping, discarded on exit).
# PDFs come back as masked plain text, so the output is a .txt file.
noirdoc redact vertrag.pdf -o vertrag-clean.txt

# Persistent namespace — placeholders stay consistent across files and sessions.
noirdoc redact --namespace mandant-mueller brief.docx -o brief-clean.docx
noirdoc reveal --namespace mandant-mueller brief-clean.docx -o brief-revealed.docx
noirdoc lookup --namespace mandant-mueller "<<PERSON_3>>"
```

```python
from noirdoc import Redactor

r = Redactor(namespace="mandant-mueller")
r.redact_file("vertrag.pdf", output="vertrag-clean.txt")  # PDFs fall back to plain text
r.redact_file("brief.docx", output="brief-clean.docx")
r.reveal_text(llm_response)  # un-redact the model's reply
```

Input:

> Anna Müller, geboren am 12.03.1981 in München, erreichbar unter 0171-2345678, Steuer-ID 12 345 678 901, IBAN DE89 3704 0044 0532 0130 00.

Output:

> `<<PERSON_1>>`, geboren am `<<DATE_TIME_1>>` in `<<LOCATION_1>>`, erreichbar unter `<<PHONE_NUMBER_1>>`, Steuer-ID `<<DE_STEUER_ID_1>>`, IBAN `<<IBAN_CODE_1>>`.

## Commands

| Command                      | What it does                                                                           |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `noirdoc redact <files>`     | Redact one or more files (accepts directories; `-o FILE` or `--output-dir DIR`).       |
| `noirdoc reveal <file>`      | Reverse pseudonyms back to originals (DOCX / XLSX / plain; `--namespace` required).    |
| `noirdoc lookup <token>`     | Resolve a pseudonym like `<<PERSON_1>>` to its original value.                         |
| `noirdoc ns list`              | List persistent namespaces.                                                            |
| `noirdoc ns summary <name>`    | Counts-only summary (entity totals + per-type counts). Safe to log.                    |
| `noirdoc ns show <name> --unsafe` | Print the full pseudonym↔original mapping as JSON. **Reveals every original value.** Requires `--unsafe`. |
| `noirdoc ns delete <name>`     | Delete a namespace (prompts for confirmation).                                         |
| `noirdoc models pull`        | Download spaCy models and (optionally) GLiNER weights up front.                        |

Run `noirdoc <cmd> --help` for the full flag list on any subcommand.

## Before you start

A few honest caveats before you ship this into a pipeline:

- **Best results need `[full]`.** On first use (or via `noirdoc models pull`) the full extra downloads roughly **560 MB** of weights: spaCy `de_core_news_lg`, Flair `ner-german-large`, and a GLiNER multilingual model. Budget disk and bandwidth.
- **Not every format survives redaction with formatting intact.** PDFs and images always come back as masked plain text, and DOCX/XLSX fall back to plain text when reconstruction fails. You can tell it happened by three signals: the CLI writes `*_redacted.txt` (an explicit non-`.txt` `-o` target is redirected to `<stem>.txt` with a warning on stderr), and the SDK's `RedactionResult` has `mime_type="text/plain"` and `reconstructed=False`, with `reason` saying why. A `.docx`/`.xlsx` path never silently receives UTF-8 text.
- **PDF reveal is not supported yet.** Round-tripping placeholders back into a PDF is a hard problem (position drift, font metrics, image-based redactions). PDFs redact cleanly; reveal is pass-through. DOCX, XLSX, and plain text round-trip.
- **XLSX output is re-serialized by openpyxl.** Redaction covers cells, `docProps` (core + custom properties), cell comments, headers/footers, pivot caches, chart string caches and titles, hyperlink tooltips/display and `mailto:` targets (the placeholder is percent-encoded in the target — `mailto:%3C%3CEMAIL_1%3E%3E` — because `<`/`>` are illegal URI characters; reveal decodes it back), AutoFilter criteria, conditional-formatting text criteria and string-literal formulas, data-validation inline lists and prompts, and pivot-table captions and label filters — and reveals them all. Threaded comments, `xl/persons` and `app.xml` Manager/Company are dropped on write (counted, not reversible); shapes, slicers, macros and other parts openpyxl cannot model do not survive the round-trip. Row 1 is treated as a header only where its own text matches the header keyword map or the column below it is unclassified; otherwise it is redacted like any data row, so a sheet with no header row does not leak its first record. Not covered yet: non-`mailto:` hyperlink URL targets, defined names and sheet titles (both would require rewriting every formula that references them).
- **DOCX redaction covers the text surfaces and the package metadata.** One shared walker drives extraction, redaction and reveal over the XML, covering: body text, content controls (`w:sdt`), tables nested at any depth, text boxes and shapes (both `mc:AlternateContent` branches on rewrite), tracked changes (inserted text is redacted like any other; deleted text is shown to the detector, then stripped from the output entirely — it is not reversible), headers/footers, review comments, and footnotes/endnotes. Inline pictures, line breaks and tab stops survive the rewrite, and a placeholder inside a hyperlink stays inside the hyperlink. A second walker pseudonymizes the package parts — `docProps` (core creator/lastModifiedBy/title/…, `app.xml` Manager/Company/HyperlinkBase/TitlesOfParts, custom properties), comment authors/initials, `word/people.xml` identities and the `mailto:` targets of hyperlink relationships (percent-encoded in the target — `mailto:%3C%3CEMAIL_1%3E%3E` — because `<`/`>` are illegal URI characters) — all reversibly. The `docProps/thumbnail.jpeg` preview (a rendered image of the original page) and `customXml/` data islands cannot be pseudonymized and are dropped on write, reported separately from the entity count because carrying them says nothing about whether a document holds PII (most Word templates ship both). Not covered yet: non-`mailto:` hyperlink targets, field instructions (`w:instrText` — mail-merge field codes), tracked-change author attributes, image alt text, and embedded objects.

- **Alpha API.** Classes and CLI flags may change between `0.2.x` and `0.3.x`. Pin accordingly.
- **Detector quality depends on the upstream models.** Presidio + Flair + GLiNER do the heavy lifting. Noirdoc adds German-specific recognizers on top, but it does not train models.

## German-first

Noirdoc defaults to German (`language="de"`) with fallback to `["de", "en"]` for mixed documents. What that actually means:

- **Custom recognizers** in `src/noirdoc/detection/presidio_detector.py`:
  - `GermanPhoneRecognizer` — German phone formats (0171-..., +49...)
  - `GermanSVNRRecognizer` — Sozialversicherungsnummer with checksum
  - `GermanSteuerIDRecognizer` — 11-digit Steuer-ID with checksum
  - `InvertedNameRecognizer` — registered for both `de` and `en` to catch "Nachname, Vorname" patterns
- **Flair `ner-german-large`** (XLM-R, F1 92.3 % on CoNLL-03 DE) handles lowercase German text — the case where spaCy tends to drop names.
- **GLiNER multilingual** catches entity types the others miss.
- **German-style lowercase** financial terms, German IBANs, German date formats, and German address patterns are covered in the test suite (`tests/test_presidio_detector.py`).

If you're working with German legal, medical, HR, or financial documents, this is what the defaults are tuned for.

## Advanced: shared mapping storage

The `[redis]` extra ships a `RedisMappingBackend` that plugs into the lower-level `MappingStore` — the same primitive Noirdoc Cloud uses for request-scoped, encrypted, TTL-bounded mapping persistence across workers. It is **not** wired into `Redactor(namespace=...)`, which persists to the local filesystem under `~/.noirdoc/namespaces/`. Use `MappingStore` when you have multiple workers that need to share pseudonym mappings for the same request, or when you want encrypted-at-rest mappings with automatic expiry.

```python
import asyncio
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet
from redis.asyncio import Redis

from noirdoc.mappings.backends.redis_backend import RedisMappingBackend
from noirdoc.mappings.store import MappingStore

async def main() -> None:
    redis = Redis.from_url("redis://localhost:6379")
    store = MappingStore(
        backend=RedisMappingBackend(redis),
        encryption_key=Fernet.generate_key(),  # keep stable across workers
    )
    # store.save(request_id=..., tenant_id=..., mapper=...)
    # mappings = await store.load(request_id)

asyncio.run(main())
```

The `encryption_key` must be identical across workers that need to read the same mappings. `MappingStore.save()` accepts a `ttl_days` kwarg (default 30).

## Noirdoc Cloud

Don't want to run this yourself? **[Noirdoc Cloud](https://noirdoc.de)** is the hosted API wrapper: a privacy-preserving reverse proxy for LLM calls that uses this exact pipeline, plus multi-tenancy, audit, and provider key management. Compliance story: what's on GitHub is what the cloud runs.

## Development

This repo uses the shared noirdoc tooling standard (`uv` + ruff/mypy). Common tasks go through `make`:

```bash
make install   # set up the dev environment
make check     # lint + format-check + typecheck + test — run before pushing
make test      # run fast tests (excludes slow ML-model tests)
```

Run `make help` for the full list of targets (also: `make lint`, `make fmt`, `make typecheck`, `make test-slow`, `make models`).
